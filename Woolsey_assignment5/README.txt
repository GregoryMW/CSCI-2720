Name of Program: main.cpp

This program consists of five sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and two Quick Sort (one for a first value pivot and another for a random pivot).
The program takes in a list of 10000 integers, either sorted or unsorted, and operated on the created array with the user defined algorithm of their choice. The program
then prints out the number of comparisons the algorithm performed throughout the sorting process, then exits the program.
